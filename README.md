"React-Native" just uses the default font family for each platform. So that's San Francisco on IOS and Roboto for Android

To add custom fonts for your project, add new font family (.ttf or otf) into the foloder 'app/assets/fonts'. Once added the required fonts, got to terminal and run "react-native link". This will link the font to android project and also ios project. You can verify the same in the android assets folder and ios fonts floder.
